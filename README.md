# Description
This project was inspired by the original game of Crossy Road, we have created a game
based on our inspiration. We have our main character (Toby) who is a dog, and the 
objective of the dog is to make it through three worlds with a limited amount of lives.

Not only that, he has to reach a certain amount of points and if caught or hit by any 
of the heavy hitting obstacles then he automatically loses his points and the user has to restart.
Also, there is a coin that will give him extra points as well as a heart that will evedentally give
Toby another life.As stated we are using Greenfoot to create this game based of the teachings and the lessons
we were given.
