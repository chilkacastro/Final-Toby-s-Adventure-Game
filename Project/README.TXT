USER INSTRUCTIONS:

This Greenfoot game is inspired by the mobile game "Crossy Road". However, in this modified version there are only three levels available. 
The main character in this game is a dog named Toby. He is a very sweet and energetic corgi who loves to sneak outside 
whenever he gets the opportunity  to do so. However, this sneaky side of his has now caused trouble because Toby 
has been missing for several weeks. His owner is so worried because he has no idea where to find Toby.
Now, poor Toby is alone wandering the streets. He is in dire need of your help to return home. So, if you have 
a golden heart, make it your duty to guide this sweet dog home. Bring joy by returning him to his loving owner.
