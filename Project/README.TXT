    Executive Summary:  
    
    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped. In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts.

-Implementing Level 4 which is more similar to sandbox games where It's like a bonus level where you get to mess around the game mechanics and special items like a sandbox. Since Toby gets inside the house in the end. The level will be themed inside of the house and you can also activate different items/actors that were used in the previous levels.

In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts. 
    Executive Summary:  
    
    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped.

In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts. 
    
    
    Executive Summary:  
    
    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped. In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them.

-Implementing Level 4 which is more similar to sandbox games where It's like a bonus level where you get to mess around the game mechanics and special items like a sandbox. Since Toby gets inside the house in the end. The level will be themed inside of the house and you can also activate different items/actors that were used in the previous levels.

    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped. In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts.

    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped. In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts.

    Executive Summary:  
    
    This game is inspired by the “Crossy Road” mobile game app. Our game consists of three levels, each one harder than the last one. We have a single character known as Toby, the dog. The overall objective of our game is to ensure that the dog makes it back home (located in level 3) safely without losing all his lives (3 initial lives); to ensure he gets back home to his owner alive or not kidnapped. In level one, we have enemies/obstacles which are traffic cones and cars. In level two, we have trains, cactus’, and a dog kidnapper/catcher, someone who catches dogs and sell them. In level three, the enemies/obstacles are cars, trucks, potholes/sewer holes, and bodies of water. The game mechanics to be used are the arrow keys which will allow the player to move Toby around. The win/lose conditions are, he starts off with 10000 points, within the number of lives given he must avoid all obstacles that reduce his points and if he encounters cars, trucks, potholes, trains, and the dog catcher/kidnapper, he loses 1000 pts. When Toby reaches home, he will get a dog treat from his owner which will increase the total score of the player. Throughout the game, the player can increase the points by picking up coins and increase Toby’s available lives by picking up hearts.
